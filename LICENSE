## Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license designed specifically to ensure that modified versions of web-based applications remain open-source, even when deployed as a service over a network.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender them. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
